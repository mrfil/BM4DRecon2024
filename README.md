This code applies the BM4D reconstruction algorithm originally developed from [1] and applies it to a spiral acquisition [2] sampled on non-cartesian coordinates. 
Some of the code developed by [1] is used in the simulation, so it has to be downloaded and added to the path.

Implemented in MATLAB R2018b.
